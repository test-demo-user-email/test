\chapter{Results}\label{cha:results}

In this chapter, you present the \textbf{found facts}, i.e. the results of your measurements, analyses, calculations, etc. If the task is more extensive and consists of several separate sections, you can also present the results from each section in separate (sub)chapters. The final form must be such that it is transparent, clear and understandable.
