\chapter{Discussion}\label{cha:discussion}

In this part, present your understanding or \textbf{explanation} of results and commentary. It is preferable that the results and the discussion of the results are presented separately (as in this proposal), but to ensure clarity and transparency if necessary (e.g. if there are many results or they are presented in different sets) you can combine the chapters Results and Discussion in one chapter (Results and discussion), where you discuss the obtained results on the fly. The final form must be such that it is transparent, clear and understandable.
