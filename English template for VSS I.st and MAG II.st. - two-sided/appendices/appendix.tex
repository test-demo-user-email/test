\chapter{Appendix A}\label{cha:priloga}

It should contain such information as is necessary to show integrity, but would interfere with the main report by distracting the reader from the main topic. These include e.g. longer executions of equations, numerical calculations, repeating diagrams, program printouts, and more.
