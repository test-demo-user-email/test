[Writing an acknowledgment or dedication is optional.]

[In the acknowledgments, write thanks to those who helped in the creation of the work and without whom the work would not have been created in the form it is. It is usually necessary to thank first and foremost the mentor, co-mentor and the institution that may have financially or otherwise supported the completion of the final work. Then there are assistants, other colleagues and your colleagues who helped with theoretical and experimental work. Finally, we usually thank the family.]
